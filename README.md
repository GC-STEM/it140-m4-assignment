- **Activity**: 4-3: Pseudocode Revisited
- **Program Name**: `hilow_game`

> [!WARNING]

> This repository is primarily to hold coding-related course materials for import into Codio. It is not intended for direct faculty or student use unless approved for that purpose.

To complete this activity, follow the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The top-level steps are listed below. See the [To-Do List](./hilow_game_todo.md) for detailed, step-by-step instructions.

## Getting Started

1. **Analyze** the [problem and requirements](./analysis/hilow_game_srs.md) to understand what needs to be done. Record your understanding of the problem and requirements in your [SDW worksheet](./analysis/hilow_game_sdw.md).

2. **Design** a solution that meets specification. Review the [Software Design Document](./design/hilow_game_sdd.md), {{along with its | and create a}} [flowchart](./design/hilow_game.drawio) and low-level [pseudocode](./design/hilow_game.pseudo).

3. **Construct** a working program in [`hilow_game.py`](./src/hilow_game.py) that implements the designed solution.

4. **Test** the program to ensure it works correctly and meets the requirements. Debug any issues that arise during testing. Test again until all issues are resolved.

5. **Submit** activity deliverables for grading and feedback. See the activity Guidelines and Rubric for what to submit and how your work will be evaluated.

### Activity Repository

The activity repository is organized to match the course Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This structure will help you organize your work and ensure that you are following the SDLC process effectively. Each folder contains specific files related to that phase of the SDLC, as outlined below:

```text

├── analysis/               # 1. Analysis: understand the problem
│   ├── hilow_game_sdw.md   # Software Development Worksheet (SDW) to plan your work
│   └── hilow_game_srs.md   # Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

└── README.md               # Start here: activity overview
```

*Note*. This repository may include additional files not listed in the main repository structure. These folders and files are essential for maintaining a well-organized and high-quality codebase, but they are not part of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and are not meant to be modified by students. Just ignore these as you work on the activity, and focus on the main repository files listed above.
